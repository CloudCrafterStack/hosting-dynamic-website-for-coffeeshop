# Reflections

## What I Learned
- EC2 with Cloud9 makes it easy to configure and manage full LAMP stacks without external SSH clients.
- AWS Secrets Manager provides secure, centralized storage for database credentials and application parameters.
- AMIs simplify duplicating environments across Regions and reduce repetitive setup work.
- Multi-Region deployment (Dev in us-east-1, Prod in us-west-2) strengthens resilience and enables safe feature testing before production.

## Future Improvements
- Use **Amazon RDS** instead of EC2-hosted MariaDB for managed, scalable database service.
- Add monitoring and alerting with **Amazon CloudWatch** for CPU, memory, and database performance.
- Automate deployments using **AWS CloudFormation** or **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code.
